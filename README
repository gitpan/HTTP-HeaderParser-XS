HTTP::HeaderParser::XS
Perlbal::XS::HTTPHeaders
========================

This module is a parser for HTTP headers, written in C++.  It uses classes
internally to provide a fast and easy to use interface to parsing,
creating, and working with HTTP headers.

This module was originally designed for use in Perlbal, a software HTTP load
balancer by Danga Interactive.

In order to use this module, you will need the Perl development libraries
along with a C++ compiler and some random assorted things that convert XS
files into C (etc).  (Not sure if this is part of the Perl development
libraries or not... but it should be pretty standard.)
